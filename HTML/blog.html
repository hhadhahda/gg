                    <p>The Nissan GT-R R34 is a legendary sports car produced by Nissan from 1999 to 2002. It is part of the Nissan Skyline GT-R lineup and is widely considered to be one of the most iconic Japanese sports cars of all time. The car was powered by a 2.6-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six engine known as the RB26DETT, which produced 276 horsepower (rumored to be closer to 320 horsepower). In 2001, Nissan introduced a revised version of the R34 GT-R, known as the V-Spec II, which featured a number of performance upgrades, including a revised rear diffuser, a new carbon fiber hood, and an engine producing 326 horsepower. The R34 GT-R gained widespread popularity after its appearance in the 2001 film "The Fast and the Furious." Production of the R34 GT-R ended in 2002, and the car remains highly sought-after by collectors and enthusiasts around the world.</p>
